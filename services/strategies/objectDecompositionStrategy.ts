[Aesthetic Philosophy]: "Sublime Micro-Engineering Narratives". A blend of surgical precision and artistic interpretation of technical components.
[Subject Input]:
Target Object: [${objectName}]
[INTELLIGENT SCENE GENERATION WORKFLOW]:
OPTION A: IF Subject is Mechanical / Tech / Masculine (Industrial Precision Mode)
[Action]: Forensic Technical Exploded View. Disassemble into 8-12 primary components, but with an emphasis on secondary and tertiary sub-components (e.g., individual gears within a gearbox, micro-switches on a circuit board, specific spring types, internal wiring harnesses).
[Detail Emphasis]: Each component is meticulously rendered.
Metals: Highlight brushed grains, polished edges, anodic oxidation sheen, laser-etched serial numbers or specific alloy markings. Show microscopic tolerances between parts.
Plastics: Reveal injection molding marks, precise seam lines, and subtle textural variations.
Circuitry: Emphasize the solder joints, traces, tiny capacitors, and integrated chip details.
Glass/Optics: Render reflections, anti-reflective coatings, and subtle refractions.
[Background]: Premium matte cool-grey workbench surface.
[Interactive Schematics]: Ultra-fine Cyan/Tech-Blue vector lines. Include cross-sectional views, exploded assembly sequence lines (dashed arrows), and material call-outs (e.g., "Alloy 7075", "Carbon Fiber Weave").
[Artistic Title Style]: "Industrial Stencil" Aesthetic. Large, bold, semi-transparent text (e.g., "PROJECT: ALPHA" or "ENGINE MODEL: X9") laser-etched onto the background surface.
OPTION B: IF Subject is Feminine / Fashion / Lifestyle (Luxury Narrative Mode)
[Action]: Curated "Magic Blind Box" Knolling. Spilled contents are arranged with obsessive attention to detail for each item.
[Detail Emphasis]: Each item, whether essential or "secret," is presented with luxurious verisimilitude.
Fabrics: Reveal intricate stitching on leather, delicate lace patterns, silk's natural sheen, and fine thread counts.
Cosmetics: Show the micro-pearls in a compact, the smooth texture of a lipstick bullet, the subtle viscosity of a serum.
Jewelry: Highlight facets of gemstones, polished metal reflections, and delicate clasps.
"Secrets": Render silicone textures, subtle glow of LED indicators on personal wellness devices, or the elegant folds of intimate garments with tasteful artistry.
[Background]: Iconic Tiffany Blue (Robin-egg blue) matte surface.
[Interactive Schematics]: Delicate White or Silver fine lines. Include fashion pattern diagrams, stylistic flow lines (emphasizing elegance), and "signature" curves (e.g., golden ratio spirals) across the composition.
[Artistic Title Style]: "Vogue Editorial" Aesthetic. Elegant, oversized Serif Typography (e.g., "THE ENSEMBLE" or "FEMME FATALE") in shimmering silver foil or embossed white ink on the blue surface.
[Universal Composition]:
Mathematical grid alignment with micro-gaps for hyper-precision. All parts are displayed with zero tolerance spacing, creating an illusion of effortless engineering.
[Universal Lighting]:
Micro-detailed, multi-point studio lighting. Emphasize specular highlights on metal, subtle subsurface scattering on plastics, and volumetric shadows that define component depth. Neutral color balance.
[Graphic Elements - The "Call-out" System] (Enhanced):
Style: Ultra-fine Hairline Pointers (Leader Lines).
Text Detail: [Bold Main Label - e.g., "Cylinder Block"] / [Tiny Sub-Label - e.g., "Aluminium Alloy 7075, Forged"] / [Micro-Spec - e.g., "Tolerance +/-0.005mm"]. This creates tiered information.
Font: Swiss-style minimalist sans-serif for clarity. Text appears digitally superimposed, razor-sharp.
[Artisan Signature Plaque] (Universal):
In the bottom-left corner: A small, highly realistic, rectangular golden metallic plaque.
Text: "Tuqu AI" in natural, elegant handwritten cursive script.
Effect: Deeply engraved/debossed look with complex metallic sheen and subtle light traps, contrasting with the technical precision.
